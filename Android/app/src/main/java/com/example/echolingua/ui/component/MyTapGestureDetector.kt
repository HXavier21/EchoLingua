 * used to detect when pointers have released or the gesture was canceled.
 * The first pointer down and final pointer up are consumed, and in the
 * case of long press, all changes after the long press is detected are consumed.
 *
 * Each function parameter receives an [Offset] representing the position relative to the containing

 * can be negative or larger than the element bounds if the touch target is smaller than the
 * [ViewConfiguration.minimumTouchTargetSize].
 *
 * When [onDoubleTap] is provided, the tap gesture is detected only after
 * the [ViewConfiguration.doubleTapMinTimeMillis] has passed and [onDoubleTap] is called if the
 * second tap is started before [ViewConfiguration.doubleTapTimeoutMillis]. If [onDoubleTap] is not
 * provided, then [onTap] is called when the pointer up has been received.
 *
 * After the initial [onPress], if the pointer moves out of the input area, the position change
 * is consumed, or another gesture consumes the down or up events, the gestures are considered
 * canceled. That means [onDoubleTap], [onLongPress], and [onTap] will not be called after a
 * gesture has been canceled.
 *
 * If the first down event is consumed somewhere else, the entire gesture will be skipped,
 * including [onPress].
